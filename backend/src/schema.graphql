"""
I need to define an user type return it
When I have '!' it means the filed is required
"""
type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    email: String!
    role: String!
}
"""
The users query means that it will return an array (even if it is empty)
and the elements must be an User

The user query have an id param that is required and returns an user.
The return is not required because if the id doesnt exists than the response is null
"""
type Query {
    users(role: String): [User!]!
    user(id: ID!): User
}

"""
The createUser mutation receives a name and email and returns that user
"""
type Mutation {
    createUser(name: String!, email: String!, role: String!): User
    updateUser(id: ID!, name: String, email: String, role: String): User
    deleteUser(id: ID!): [User!]!
}
